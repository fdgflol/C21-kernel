# C21-kernel
It's a bootloader I made using assembly. it actually loads your kernel now and handles disk failure.
yes I know only assembly is a bootloader but I will make it a kernel soon. The "Add new code file" is the source code for boot2.img. ignore its name I thought the name will be the commit message.
